# Example for Essential Accessiblity

This project is my test response for the Full Stack Developer role.

I took some liberty in making some choices that might make it easier to demonstrte certain concepts i.e. I put the quote and form in separate columns to show responsivity.

I also enjoyed looking into some accessiblity concepts like the screen reader text and took the liberty of adding aria-labels where I thought it would show the purpose of an html element.

To run, complete the steps below. 

------------------------------
1) Check out the source code
------------------------------

In a unix terminal window:

i) Run the command, to check out the project to a root project directory:

git clone https://github.com/rakkatak/essential-test.git

ii) Note the directory where the project has been checked out to. This will be referred to as <project_root> for the remaining steps.

------------------------------
2) Run the node server
------------------------------

The <project_root>/node_server directory node_server contains the contents of the node server. 

To test, in another unix terminal window:

i) Navigte to <project_root>/node_server

ii) run npm install

iii) run:
node index.js

Note: Please keep this terminal window open for the send button to work 

------------------------------
3) Load the application
------------------------------

In your file explorer:

i) Navigate to <project_root>

ii) Double click index.html to open in Chrome

Test and enjoy :D
